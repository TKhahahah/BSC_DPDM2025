## Data Mining Functions

| Functions  | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Generalization  | summarises general features or elements of the data to establish specific rules for defining a target class |
| Pattern Discovery  | helps find relationships between items that commonly appear together. It is also called market-basket analysis |
| Classification | the separation of data elements in a collection into classes according to their predetermined functionalities and characteristics|
| Cluster Analysis | similar data are grouped—or clustered—together under an unknown class label |
|Outlier Analysis | helps understand data quality and using a data set with high outliers is not a wise option for finding patterns in the data or drawing any conclusions|
|Time and Ordering:Sequential Pattern, Trend and Evolution Analysis | Businesses can predict the outcomes of any given occurrence, whether favourable or unfavourable, using linear regression models based on historical data to produce numerical forecasts |
| Structure and Network Analysis | Graph mining, Information network analysis, Web mining |


Data Mining: Confluence of Multiple Disciplines 

is blending methodologies from various fields to achieve the goal of extracting valuable knowledge and patterns from large datasets.
